## Overview

### About

The purpose of the website is to calculate the user's age based on their date of birth and display errors if the form is filled out incorrectly, such as:

- Any field is empty when the form is submitted
- The day number is not between 1-31
- The month number is not between 1-12
- The date is in the future
- The date is invalid, e.g., 31/04/1991 (April has only 30 days)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Challenges and learnings

Overall, the development of this app was quite smooth. I believe my only challenge was calculating the dates, which can be quite tricky at times. I refactored the code to get used to refactoring after completing all the logic, and without a doubt, this will greatly enhance my skills as a developer. I also made the website responsive so it can be used on mobile devices and to practice my responsiveness skills
